# Web-CYOA-Airtable
This code is a blend of an Airtable CYOA (The Phantom Tollbooth) and a code-only CYOA.  The code section, characters, involves rolling D&D Dice, and is associated with Batman characters. 
Use conditional logic to switch between the database version and the code subfolders.  Try to keep webhelper and styles in the parent, adding to the children only what only pertains to the children.  Note the use of ../ links in child folder to refer to parent files. Never have a function with the same name in the child and the parent, except for story - and never refer to ../story.js in the parent. 
The database associated with this repo is owned by bram@greenfielddigital.com, is called Tollbooth CYOA, RPG Tollbook Batman with key keyCTEV1rBtpMeDDa.
