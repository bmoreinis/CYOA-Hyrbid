# Web-CYOA-Airtable
This code is a blend of an Airtable CYOA and a code-only CYOA. Use conditional logic to switch between the database version and the code subfolders.  Try to keep webhelper and styles in the parent, adding to the children only what only pertains to the children.  Note the use of ../ links in child folder to refer to parent files. Never have a function with the same name in the child and the parent, except for story - and never refer to ../story.js in the parent. 
The databse associated with this repo is RPG Tollbook Batman with keyJLBdH3ktq1BJ8L (is it?)
